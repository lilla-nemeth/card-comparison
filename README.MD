# FlavourFlow - Card comparison  

### üõ† Technologies used  
TypeScript, React, Sass, Framer Motion (for animation)

### üìÑ The task 

Create a Tinderesque interface. Instead of swiping one card from the deck to left and right, the users should choose between two cards based on their preferences and through click actions the cards should animate to up and down.  

For the task I followed the instructions and what is common sense.  
For instance, I did not see the point comparing 2 different attributes:

**Traditional breakfast** vs. **Quick and easy**  

Instead my changes compare 2 cards if they belong to the same group:   

**Sweet** vs. **Savory**

### üí° My future development idea was:  
If the user clicked on all the attributes then a second round filtering would start with categories.
That is why I extended the FlavourFlow data with categories and new attributes.  

An example of the flow could be:  

#### 1. Round (Attributes):  
- User chooses **Requires more time** over **Quick and easy** from **Preparation time** category.  
- User chooses **Premium Ingredients** over **Affordable Ingredients** from **Cost** category.  

#### 2. Round (Categories):  
- User chooses **Preparation Time** over **Cost**, because he likes spending time in his kitchen, and is more important for him than the price of the ingredients.
